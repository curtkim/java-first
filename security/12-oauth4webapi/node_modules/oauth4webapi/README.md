# OAuth 2 / OpenID Connect for Web Platform API JavaScript runtimes

This software is a collection of routines upon which framework-specific client modules may be written. Its objective is to support and, where possible, enforce secure and current best practices using only capabilities common to Browser and Non-Browser JavaScript-based runtime environments.

Target profiles of this software are OAuth 2.1, OAuth 2.0 complemented by the latest Security BCP, and FAPI 2.0. Where applicable OpenID Connect is also supported.

## In Scope & Implemented

- Authorization Server Metadata discovery
- Authorization Code Flow (profiled under OpenID Connect 1.0, OAuth 2.0, OAuth 2.1, and FAPI 2.0), PKCE
- Refresh Token, Device Authorization, and Client Credentials Grants
- Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP)
- Token Introspection and Revocation
- Pushed Authorization Requests (PAR)
- UserInfo and Protected Resource Requests
- Authorization Server Issuer Identification
- JWT Secured Introspection, Response Mode (JARM), Authorization Request (JAR), and UserInfo
